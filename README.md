### Hi there I'm Lydia 👋

I finished the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course in March 2021 and am looking for a role to let me start using the skills I've gained! 

Currently I'm:
- ⚙️ Learning more about accessibility
- 🐛 Trying to figure out a few bugs in my projects

You can find some projects I worked on during the GA course below. These are:
1. <a href="https://lydiarrrw.github.io/project-1/">ROSHMAN</a> - A pacman style game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.👻
2. <a href="https://lydiarrrw.github.io/project-2/">REXFLIX</a> - A movie recommendations site built using React and The Movie Database API.🦖
3. <a href="https://stepladderlw.herokuapp.com/">Stepladder</a> - A glassdoor style full-stack site - it's fun to make your own imaginary companies!💼
4. <a href="http://dreamlandlw.herokuapp.com/">Dreamland</a> - A full-stack site designed for use at a festival - where we booked some great acts!🎶
