### Hi there I'm Lydia 👋

Currently I'm:
- ⚙️  Learning more about accessibility
- 🙃 Building some fun things
- 🐛  Trying to figure out a few bugs in my projects

Things I've been working on recently:
1. Making my portfolio site bright like the sun: <a href="https://www.lydiawood.co.uk/">lydiawood.co.uk</a>
2. Trying to build an online galette builder, because Bretagne ❤️ 🇫🇷 <a href="https://github.com/lydiarrrw/galette-simple">see where I'm up to with my code here.</a> A live version is coming soon.
3. Sun, rain or snow; I'm a strong believer that it's nearly always weather for a BBQ so I built <a href="https://lydiarrrw.github.io/bbquestion/">this to help you decide.</a> Disclaimer: sometimes the API is a bit inaccurate.

I finished the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course in March 2021 where I built these: 
1. <a href="https://lydiarrrw.github.io/project-1/">ROSHMAN</a> - A pacman style game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.👻
2. <a href="https://lydiarrrw.github.io/project-2/">REXFLIX</a> - A movie recommendations site built using React and The Movie Database API.🦖
3. <a href="https://stepladderlw.herokuapp.com/">Stepladder</a> - A glassdoor style full-stack site - it's fun to make your own imaginary companies!💼
4. <a href="http://dreamlandlw.herokuapp.com/">Dreamland</a> - A full-stack site designed for use at a festival - where we booked some great acts!🎶
